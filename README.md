# Hummingbirds
This is a repository of code used for my thesis project, studying community dynamics among PIT-tagged hummingbirds.

# Background

Between 2016 and 2021, over 1000 hummingbirds were PIT-tagged by Dr. Lisa Tell of U.C. Davis at 2 sites in California (Beverly Hills and Winters). They were then turned loose and allowed to use RFID-reader-equipped hummingbird feeders freely. These feeders record detections of each individual's microchip, which is programmed with an ID (RFID_hex), age (HY or AHY), Sex, Genus, Species, band ID, and other biometrics data that was collected at the time of capture.
